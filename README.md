# Canvas-2D-Platformer-Game

Canvas is an HTML5 element which can be used to draw graphics via scripting (usually JavaScript).<br>
In this project I worked a lot with methods, objects, classes, constructors, keyboard events, mouse events and with little math.<br>
I used math to create algorithms such as:<br>
  -detect distance between two objects in the plan<br>
  -determining angle between two objects<br>
  -collision detection<br>
This algorithms compose the logic of the game.
